Setting short, medium and long-term milestones, we begin by defining the minimum number of features a product needs to go on the market (MVP), those that can be added in phase two, those that are nice to have, and those that will be discarded for technical or other reasons. This roadmap then forms a solid basis for characterization and design of the product.</p>
