                            <p>With the users defined and an idea of the product – either general or specific at this stage - we embark on a Design Sprint. Over the course of up to five days, we look at the product from every possible angle, weighing up the pros and cons of every feature, and examining every detail to create the product customers dream of. Incorporating a high level of characterization, the resulting prototype is then subjected to testing by a representative sample of target users. Taking on board their feedback to fix, enhance or even ditch specific features, we end up with a clear idea of how the product will look and behave - and crucially, what users think about it - leaping months ahead in the product development process </p>

Taking into account business goals and any relevant technical constraints, our UX design process takes our clients from concept through navigation to the information architecture, arriving at a document that sets out everything that will go into the product.</p>
                            <p>We then produce a wireframe of the main navigation screen, complete with design look & feel, presenting a functional product that we review together, making real-time updates as we go</p>

                            <p>This is where we drill down into the user experience to ascertain whether the product is fit for purpose. We want to know: do users easily understand how to use the product? Is it actually useful? Does it answer the users’ needs? The result is an actionable document detailing what works well, what is less effective, and what needs to be fixed, all prioritized</p>

                            <br> That’s why we take every element of a branding and visual identity and test it out – from icons and illustrations to fonts and layouts – making sure that it all still pops once the digital transformation has been achieved.</p>
